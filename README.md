# About Me
## Professional things to know about me

I enjoy personality tests and learning about myself, and yes I do understand that these sorts of tests aren't terribly rigorous, but they do provide thinking points:

**Myers-Briggs** - (I,E)NFP - So I'm either a [Campaigner](https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality) or a [Mediator](https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality), depending on the situation.

**DISC** - [(Counselor)](https://www.discprofiles4u.com/blog/2012/disc-classic-profile-counselor-pattern-8-of-16/)
> Counselor pattern embrace others with their warmth, empathy, and understanding. They are long term relationship builders.  They are good listeners, and effective at problem solving. Counselors use an indirect approach when dealing with others.  They tend to put people first, by providing recognition to others, – they attribute less importance to task accomplishment.  They’re apt to be overly-tolerant with others. When in a position of authority and responsibility, Counselors like to be appreciated, for their contribution. They are calm, sincere and loyal.

I think this a good reflection of how I operate on teams. My biggest focus is typically on "how can I help my team accomplish my goals?". That's why I usually end up playing the role of "glue" on most of my teams.

## Short Bio
Hailing from the cold northern plains of Canada, Anton had nothing better to do while growing up then basking in the warmth of his computers. His passion for computers was so fervent that despite the great dot com bubble crash of the early 2000's, Anton decided to enroll at the University of Toronto for computer science anyway. Following graduation, Anton entered the workforce, where he has spent the last few years navigating the harrowing twists and turns of software development, weathering the IT world with pride and gumption.

## Fun facts
- Anton once finished 2nd place at a prestigious magic tournament, where there were only 2 participants.
- If it wasn't for that pesky Canadian food guide, Anton's diet would consist primarily of cheese.
- In 2018, Anton managed to convince [PyCon Canada](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiHOXwbq49w) to let him give a 45 minute talk on emails and Seinfeld.
